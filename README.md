# ⚡ EvileSP Web Flasher ⚡

Welcome to **EvileSP Web Flasher** – my browser-based firmware flasher where I host my own projects, and sometimes share other projects that don’t have a web flasher, making it **super easy to flash firmware directly from your browser**.

I designed this interface to be **clean, hacker-style, and user-friendly**, but it’s still a work in progress. I’m continuously improving it.  

If you’d like to **add your project** to this flasher, reach out – I might include it!  

Flashing firmware is **simple and straightforward**, just a few clicks and you’re done. While the interface is still being polished, future updates will include:

- ⚡ Ability to **download binary files** when selecting firmware  
- ⚡ **Detailed information and schematics** so you don’t have to leave the flasher or visit GitHub  
- ⚡ **Tutorials and videos** to guide installation and setup – making it easy even for beginners  

The goal is to make firmware flashing **fast, transparent, and fun**, while continuously expanding its features.
